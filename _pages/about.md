I'm an incoming PhD researcher at the [VIS Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/), supervised by [Cees Snoek](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=0uKdbscAAAAJ&hl=en), where I work on generalist multimodal foundation models as part of the Horizon Europe [ELLIOT project](https://ellis.eu/news/new-eu-project-elliot-aims-to-advance-multimodal-generalist-foundation-models). My research focuses on designing unified architectures that combine modalities into a shared space, aiming for models that generalize well, adapt efficiently, and assist meaningfully across a wide range of tasks. 

Previously, I worked on combining discrete diffusion and autoregression for [multilingual image generation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cJJWSktAWzTWER669yVltKTpekXWKVB-XXFD_YVmdBc/edit?usp=sharing) with [Mohammad M. Derakhshani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n7GnOJoAAAAJ&hl=en), and explored curriculum learning in vision-language models under the supervision of [Yuki Asano](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=CdpLhlgAAAAJ&hl=en).

At my core, Iâ€™m an applied engineer with an enthusiasm for recreating intelligence that serves as a tool, to make tasks easier for the human user. Sample efficiency in learning, blurring the context window, and unified representation spaces - all capture my [attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) at the moment.
