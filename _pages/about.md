I'm currently working on combining discrete diffusion and autoregression for [multilingual image generation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cJJWSktAWzTWER669yVltKTpekXWKVB-XXFD_YVmdBc/edit?usp=sharing) with [Mohammad Mahdi Derakhshani](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n7GnOJoAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Cees Sneok](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?user=0uKdbscAAAAJ&hl=en) at the [VIS lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/). Previously, for my thesis, I explored curriculum learning in Visual Language Models, supervised by [Yuki Asano](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=CdpLhlgAAAAJ&hl=en).

At my core, Iâ€™m an applied engineer with an enthusiasm for recreating intelligence that serves as a tool, to make tasks easier for the human user. Sample efficiency in learning, blurring the context window, multimodal architectures and embodied intelligence - all capture my [attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) at the moment.
